# Alert on any EMS message generated by FSx for ONTAP

## Introduction
Included in the folder is a CloudFormation template that will deploy the
[Monitor FSx for ONTAP Services](https://github.com/NetApp/FSx-ONTAP-monitoring/tree/main/Monitor-FSx-ONTAP-Servies)
program that will, by default, just enable the EMS event alerting. You are free
to enable any of the other monitoring features that are available in the program. See the
[README.md](https://github.com/NetApp/FSx-ONTAP-monitoring/tree/main/Monitor-FSx-ONTAP-Servies/README.md)
file in the [Montor-FSx-ONTAP-Services](https://github.com/NetApp/FSx-ONTAP-monitoring/tree/main/Monitor-FSx-ONTAP-Servies)
directory for more information what services can be monitored and how this program works.
